# School Projects
Welcome to my high school computer science project repository! Here, you will find a collection of projects that I completed during my time in high school, in classes such as AP Computer Science A, Computer Science in the 21st Century, VR and Game Development, and Mobile Applications Development.

These projects showcase the skills and knowledge I gained in these classes, and provide a glimpse into my abilities as a programmer. They may include applications, games, or other software that I developed using a variety of programming languages and technologies.

Please feel free to browse through the projects and see what I have created. Thank you for visiting!
